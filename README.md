LaTeX-IPA
=========

This is a compilation of snippets for the TIPA package in LaTeX. It is not exhaustive, but I plan to continue adding more.

### File naming
Consonants are labeled in the following way:
voicing - point of articulation - mode of articulation

Ex. voiceless-bilabial-aprox.sublime-snippet = [Î²]

Vowels are labeled in the following way:
vowel - tense/lax - height - frontedness - rounding

Ex. vowel-tense-high-front-unrounded.sublime-snippet = [i]
