LaTeX-IPA
=========

This is a compilation of snippets for the TIPA package in LaTeX. It is not exhaustive, but I plan to continue adding more.

### File naming
Consonants are labeled in the following way:  
voicing - point of articulation - mode of articulation  
Ex. voiceless-bilabial-aprox.sublime-snippet = [Î²]

Vowels are labeled in the following way:  
vowel - tense/lax - height - frontedness - rounding  
Ex. vowel-tense-high-front-unrounded.sublime-snippet = [i]

### Tab triggers
There are three main groups:

**Diacritics**: type "diac" + tab  
**Vowels**: type "vowel" + tab  
**Consontants**: type "cons" + tab

Consonants also have two subcategories:  
**Liquids**: type "liquid" + tab  
**Nasals**: type "nasal" + tab

### Notes
As of now (10/19/2013), I have only included the symbols that I use the most in English and Spanish. I will continue adding to the repository over time. Specifically, I plan to change the "cons" tab trigger and use the mode of articulation to divide groups.
