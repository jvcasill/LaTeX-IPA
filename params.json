{"name":"Latex-ipa","tagline":"","body":"LaTeX-IPA\r\n=========\r\nThis is a compilation of snippets for the TIPA package in LaTeX. It is not exhaustive, but I plan to continue adding more.\r\n\r\n### File naming  \r\nConsonants are labeled in the following way:  \r\nvoicing - point of articulation - mode of articulation  \r\nEx. voiceless-bilabial-aprox.sublime-snippet = [Î²]\r\n\r\nVowels are labeled in the following way:  \r\nvowel - tense/lax - height - frontedness - rounding  \r\nEx. vowel-tense-high-front-unrounded.sublime-snippet = [i]\r\n\r\n### Tab triggers\r\nThere are 6 main groups:  \r\n**Diacritics**: type \"diac\" + tab  \r\n**Vowels**: type \"vowel\" + tab  \r\nConsonants are divided into four subcategories:  \r\n**Fricatives** type \"fric\" + tab  \r\n**Affricates** type \"affr\" + tab  \r\n**Liquids**: type \"liquid\" + tab  \r\n**Nasals**: type \"nasal\" + tab\r\n\r\n### Notes  \r\nAs of now (10/19/2013), I have only included the symbols that I use the most in English and Spanish. I will continue adding to the repository over time. It should be noted that the consonants do not include all categories (i.e. stops). This is because they are not represented by unsual symbols in IPA. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
